<!-- 4. Write a short note on Tag and element with an example.
 Ans- 1. Tags:

Tags are the markup characters used to define the beginning and end of an HTML element.
Tags are enclosed in angle brackets < > and are case-insensitive in HTML (though it's a convention to use lowercase).
Tags are used to provide instructions to the web browser on how to display or structure the content within them.

EX:- <img>, <p>,<h1>,<ul>,<li>

    2. Elements:

Elements consist of a pair of opening and closing tags, and the content placed between them.
Elements can be nested inside one another, creating a hierarchical structure for the webpage's content.
Elements can have attributes (additional information) specified within their opening tags.
EX:
<a href="www.google.com">google.com</a>
-->


<!-- 5. What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML"
In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), the <!DOCTYPE> declaration is a special instruction at the beginning of an HTML document that specifies the document type definition and version of HTML being used. It informs the web browser about the version of HTML in which the document is written, allowing the browser to interpret and render the document correctly. The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it's an instruction to the browser. -->
