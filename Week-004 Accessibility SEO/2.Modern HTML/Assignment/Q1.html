  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>HTML5 Features</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Semantic Elements:</strong> HTML5 introduced new semantic
        elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt;,
        &lt;article&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, and more, which provide a better
        structure and meaning to web documents.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Audio and Video:</strong> HTML5 includes native support for
        embedding audio and video content with the &lt;audio&gt; and
        &lt;video&gt; elements, reducing the need for third-party plugins like
        Flash.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Canvas:</strong> The &lt;canvas&gt; element allows for dynamic
        rendering of graphics and animations directly within the web page,
        enabling the creation of interactive games and visualizations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>SVG:</strong> Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) can be embedded
        directly using the &lt;svg&gt; element, providing support for
        high-quality, resolution-independent graphics.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Geolocation:</strong> HTML5 includes a Geolocation API that
        allows websites to request and obtain the user's geographical location,
        enabling location-based services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Local Storage:</strong> The Web Storage API introduced
        localStorage and sessionStorage, allowing web applications to store data
        locally on the user's device, reducing the need for cookies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Web Workers:</strong> Web Workers enable multi-threading in
        JavaScript, allowing time-consuming tasks to run in the background
        without freezing the main user interface.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>WebSockets:</strong> HTML5 introduced the WebSocket API,
        enabling real-time, full-duplex communication between the client and
        server over a single, long-lived connection.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Form Improvements:</strong> New input types like &lt;email&gt;,
        &lt;url&gt;, and &lt;number&gt; were introduced, along with form
        validation and the &lt;datalist&gt; element for providing autocomplete
        suggestions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Responsive Web Design:</strong> HTML5, along with CSS3, promotes
        responsive web design by providing tools like media queries and the
        &lt;picture&gt; element for creating websites that adapt to various
        screen sizes and devices.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Drag and Drop:</strong> HTML5 introduced native support for
        drag-and-drop operations, making it easier to create interactive
        interfaces for file uploads and content manipulation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Offline Web Applications:</strong> The Application Cache
        (AppCache) and Service Workers allow web applications to work offline or
        with limited connectivity, improving the user experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Web Components:</strong> HTML5 introduced the concept of Web
        Components, enabling the creation of reusable custom elements with
        encapsulated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Improved Accessibility:</strong> HTML5 introduced ARIA
        (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes and roles to enhance
        web accessibility for people with disabilities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Client-Side Storage:</strong> In addition to Web Storage, HTML5
        introduced IndexedDB, a more advanced client-side database for storing
        structured data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Semantic Forms:</strong> HTML5 introduced the &lt;fieldset&gt;,
        &lt;legend&gt;, and &lt;datalist&gt; elements to improve the semantics
        and organization of forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> HTML5 includes security features
        like Content Security Policy (CSP) and the &lt;iframe&gt; sandbox
        attribute to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cross-document Messaging:</strong> The
        <code>postMessage</code> API allows secure communication between
        different windows or frames.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Improved Parsing:</strong> HTML5 parsers are more forgiving,
        making it easier to work with malformed or incomplete HTML documents.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>New APIs:</strong> HTML5 introduced various JavaScript APIs like
        the History API, Web Storage, WebSockets, and more, enabling advanced
        client-side functionality.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      These are some of the prominent features of HTML5 that have made it a
      powerful and versatile markup language for building modern web
      applications and websites.
