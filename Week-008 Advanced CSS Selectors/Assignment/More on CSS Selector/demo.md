# Styling Instructions for `index.html`

## A. Create and Link a CSS File

1. Create a CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) to apply styles to the HTML elements.

2. Link the CSS file to the `index.html` file using the following code in the HTML `<head>` section:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css" />
   ```
````

## B. Using Combinator Selectors

1. Use any CSS combinator selector to target all anchor tags and change the text color to red.

   Example CSS:

   ```css
   a {
     color: red;
   }
   ```

2. Target only the first `<h2>` tag and change the text and background color using the combinator selector.

   Example CSS:

   ```css
   h2:first-of-type {
     color: blue;
     background-color: yellow;
   }
   ```

3. Select the first `<p>` tag and change the text color to red.

   Example CSS:

   ```css
   p:first-of-type {
       color: red;
   ```

## C. Using Attribute Selectors

1. Target the anchor tag with the `href` attribute and change the text color to red and remove the text underline.

   Example CSS:

   ```css
   a[href] {
       color: red;
       text-decoration: none;
   ```

2. Target the anchor tag with the class name "active," change the text color, and provide text style properties with underlining.

   Example CSS:

   ```css
   a.active {
       color: green;
       text-decoration: underline;
   ```

3. Target the anchor tag with the `target` attribute whose value is "\_self" and change the background color.

   Example CSS:

   ```css
   a[target="_self"] {
       background-color: pink;
   ```

## D. Using Pseudo Selectors

1. Target the last `<p>` tag and add "..." (three dots) after its value.

   Example CSS:

   ```css
   p:last-of-type::after {
       content: "...";
   ```

2. Target the list of bullet points and change the color of the bullet points without changing the list item's value.

   Example CSS:

   ```css
   li::before {
       color: orange;
   ```

3. Among the three `<p>` tags, target the 2nd `<p>` tag, select the first letter of the second `<p>` tag, and change the color to red. Also, increase the font size to 30px.

   Example CSS:

   ```css
   p:nth-of-type(2)::first-letter {
       color: red;
       font-size: 30px;
   ```
