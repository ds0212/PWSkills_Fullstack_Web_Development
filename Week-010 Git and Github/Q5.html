    <h2>Contributing to Open Source on GitHub</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Select a Project</h3>
    <p>
      Start by choosing an open-source project you're interested in. Explore
      GitHub's "Explore" tab or search for projects in your area of interest.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2: Fork the Repository</h3>
    <p>
      Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the project's GitHub
      repository. This creates a copy of the project in your GitHub account.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3: Clone Your Fork</h3>
    <p>Clone your fork to your local machine using the following command:</p>
    <pre><code>git clone &lt;your-fork-url&gt;</code></pre>

    <h3>Step 4: Create a New Branch</h3>
    <p>
      Create a new branch for your contributions using the following command:
    </p>
    <pre><code>git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name</code></pre>

    <h3>Step 5: Make Changes</h3>
    <p>
      Make your code changes, add features, fix bugs, or update documentation in
      your local branch.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 6: Commit Changes</h3>
    <p>
      Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message using the
      following command:
    </p>
    <pre><code>git commit -m "Your informative commit message"</code></pre>

    <h3>Step 7: Push to Your Fork</h3>
    <p>Push your changes to your fork on GitHub using the following command:</p>
    <pre><code>git push origin feature/your-feature-name</code></pre>

    <h3>Step 8: Create a Pull Request (PR)</h3>
    <p>
      Go to the original project's GitHub repository and create a pull request
      with a clear description of your changes. Reference related issues if
      applicable.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 9: Discuss and Review</h3>
    <p>
      Expect feedback and discussions on your pull request. Make necessary
      adjustments based on the feedback to improve your contribution.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 10: Continuous Integration (CI)</h>
    <p>
      Ensure your changes pass any CI checks (e.g., code formatting, tests) if
      the project has them in place.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 11: Approval and Merging</h3>
    <p>
      Once your pull request is approved and passes all checks, a project
      maintainer will merge it into the main project branch.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 12: Cleanup</h3>
    <p>
      After your pull request is merged, you can delete the branch both locally
      and on your remote fork.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 13: Stay Engaged</h3>
    <p>
      Stay involved with the project, follow its updates, and consider
      contributing to more issues or features in the future.
