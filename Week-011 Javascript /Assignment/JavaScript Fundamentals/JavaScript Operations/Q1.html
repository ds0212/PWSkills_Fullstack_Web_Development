    <h1>Understanding the Role of Operators in JavaScript</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>What are Operators:</h2>
      <p>
        In JavaScript, operators are symbols or keywords that perform operations
        on variables and values. They act on operands to produce a result.
        Operators are essential for manipulating data, making decisions, and
        performing calculations in programming.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Types of Operators:</h2>
      <p>JavaScript includes various types of operators:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Arithmetic Operators:</strong> Perform mathematical operations
          (e.g., +, -, *, /).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Assignment Operators:</strong> Assign values to variables
          (e.g., =, +=, -=).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Comparison Operators:</strong> Compare values and return a
          boolean result (e.g., ==, !==, >).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Logical Operators:</strong> Perform logical operations and
          return a boolean result (e.g., &&, ||, !).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unary Operators:</strong> Operate on a single operand (e.g.,
          ++, --).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ternary Operator:</strong> A shorthand for an 'if-else'
          statement (e.g., ? :).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bitwise Operators:</strong> Perform bitwise operations on
          binary representations of numbers.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why Operators are Essential:</h2>
      <p>Operators play a crucial role in programming for several reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Manipulation:</strong> Operators allow you to perform
          calculations and manipulate data, making it possible to create dynamic
          and interactive applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Decision Making:</strong> Comparison and logical operators are
          essential for making decisions and controlling the flow of your
          program through conditional statements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Variable Assignment:</strong> Assignment operators are used to
          assign values to variables, updating their content as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mathematical Operations:</strong> Arithmetic operators enable
          you to perform mathematical calculations, making it easy to work with
          numbers in your code.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Example:</h2>
      <p>
        Here's a simple example demonstrating the use of operators in
        JavaScript:
      </p>

      <pre>
            <code>
                &lt;script&gt;
                    // Arithmetic operators
                    let num1 = 10;
                    let num2 = 5;
                    let sum = num1 + num2;

                    // Comparison operator
                    let isGreaterThan = num1 > num2;

                    // Logical operator
                    let isValid = true;
                    let hasPermission = false;
                    let canAccessResource = isValid && !hasPermission;

                    console.log(sum, isGreaterThan, canAccessResource);
                &lt;/script&gt;
            </code>
        </pre>
