      <h2>JavaScript Overview:</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used in web
        development. Originally designed to add interactivity to static HTML
        pages, it plays a crucial role in creating dynamic and engaging user
        experiences. Basically it add functionality to the application.

        <li>
          <strong>Dynamic Content:</strong> JavaScript enables developers to
          manipulate the content of a web page dynamically. It can update or
          change the content of HTML elements in response to user actions or
          events.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Interactivity:</strong> JavaScript is essential for creating
          interactive elements on a web page, such as forms validation, image
          sliders, accordions, and other components that respond to user input.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Asynchronous Requests:</strong> JavaScript allows for
          asynchronous communication with servers, typically through
          technologies like AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML). This enables
          web pages to fetch data from a server in the background, improving
          user experience.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Event Handling:</strong> JavaScript can respond to various
          events, including user clicks, mouse movements, or keyboard inputs.
          Event handlers written in JavaScript trigger specific actions in
          response to these events.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Browser Manipulation:</strong> JavaScript can manipulate the
          browser's Document Object Model (DOM), representing the structure of
          an HTML document. This allows developers to dynamically modify the
          structure and content of a web page.
