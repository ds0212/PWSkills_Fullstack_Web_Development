    <h1>Primitive Data Types in JavaScript</h1>

    <p>
      In JavaScript, primitive data types are basic data types that represent
      single values. They are immutable (cannot be changed) and are used to
      store simple values. Here are the five primitive data types in JavaScript,
      along with brief descriptions:
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Number:</h2>
      <p>
        Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point
        numbers.
      </p>
      <p>Example: <code>let age = 25;</code></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>String:</h2>
      <p>Represents sequences of characters, typically used for text.</p>
      <p>Example: <code>let name = "John";</code></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Boolean:</h2>
      <p>Represents a logical value indicating either true or false.</p>
      <p>Example: <code>let isStudent = true;</code></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Null:</h2>
      <p>Represents the intentional absence of any object value.</p>
      <p>Example: <code>let data = null;</code></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Undefined:</h2>
      <p>
        Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
      </p>
      <p>Example: <code>let undefinedVar;</code></p>
    </section>

    <p>
      These primitive data types are the building blocks for more complex data
      structures and objects in JavaScript. It's important to note that these
      types are stored by value, meaning when you assign a primitive variable to
      another, you are making a copy of the value. This is in contrast to
      objects, which are stored by reference.
