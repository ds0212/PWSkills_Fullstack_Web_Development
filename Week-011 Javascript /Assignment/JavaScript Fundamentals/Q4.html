      <h2>Purpose of Declaring Variables:</h2>
      <p>
        Variables in JavaScript are used to store and manage data in your
        programs. They provide a way to name and reference values, making your
        code more readable and maintainable. Variables allow you to store
        different types of data, from numbers and strings to more complex
        objects.

      <h2>Declaring Variables with the 'let' Keyword:</h2>
      <p>
        In JavaScript, you can declare variables using the 'let' keyword. The
        'let' keyword is used for block-scoped variable declarations. Here's an
        example:
      </p>

      <pre>
             <code>
                 &lt;script&gt;
                     // Declare a variable named 'greeting' and assign the value "Hello, World!"
                     let greeting = "Hello, World!";
 
                     // Output the value of the 'greeting' variable to the console
                     console.log(greeting);
                 &lt;/script&gt;
             </code>
         </pre>

      <p>
        In this example, the 'let' keyword is used to declare a variable named
        'greeting' and assign the string "Hello, World!" to it. The
        'console.log()' statement is then used to output the value of the
        'greeting' variable to the console.
      </p>

      <h2>Variable Naming Rules:</h2>
      <p>
        When declaring variables in JavaScript, it's important to follow certain
        naming rules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Variable names are case-sensitive.</li>
        <li>
          Variable names can include letters, digits, underscores, and dollar
          signs.
        </li>
        <li>Variable names cannot start with a digit.</li>
        <li>
          Variable names should be descriptive and follow a camelCase or
          snake_case convention for readability.
        </li>
      </ul>
