// Write a JavaScript program that calculates the simple interest using the formula Simple interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100.

let principal = 23;
let rate = 12;
let time = 3;

let simpleInterest = (principal * rate * time) / 100;

console.log(` The simple interest is ${simpleInterest}.`);

// The simple interest is 8.28.
